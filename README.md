## Design

The website is designed with a modern and clean aesthetic to ensure a user-friendly experience that aligns with John Doe's professional brand.

### Color Scheme
The color scheme is minimalist, focusing on three primary colors:

- **Black:** Conveys professionalism and trust.
- **White (#FFFFFF):** Provides a clean and open background.
- **Gray:** Highlights important elements like buttons and links.

### Typography

I went for a google font Poppins because of it's simple and effective look, making it easy for the eye to read. Below is a screenshot of the font.
Font sizes vary from 16px for regular text to 48px for headers to create a clear hierarchy.

### Layout and Structure
The website uses a responsive grid layout with CSS Flexbox, optimized for all devices:

- **Header** with a sticky navigation menu.
- **Main content area** for portfolio highlights and skills.
- **Footer** with social links and contact information.

### Wireframes
Only a singular wireframe was created in https://app.diagrams.net/ 
As the simplicity of the website only needed 1 layout.

- **Accessibility:** Ensures compliance with WCAG standards.
