The color scheme is minimalist, focusing on three primary colors:

### Typography

I went for a google font Poppins because of it's simple and effective look, making it easy for the eye to read. Below is a screenshot of the font.
Font sizes vary from 16px for regular text to 48px for headers to create a clear hierarchy.

Only a singular wireframe was created in https://app.diagrams.net/
