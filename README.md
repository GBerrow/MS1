### Mobile Responsiveness Testing

The website was tested on various mobile devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality:

- **iPhone SE** (iOS 14)  
  ![iPhone SE](assets/images/testing/iphone-se.png)

- **Samsung Galaxy S8** (Android 9)  
  ![Samsung Galaxy S8](assets/images/testing/samsung-galaxy-s8.png)

Both portrait and landscape modes were tested to ensure that the layout, images, and interactive elements adjusted correctly. All interactions, such as tapping buttons and submitting forms, worked as expected, with no visual or functional issues identified.

### Cross Browser Console Output Testing

The website was tested using the developer console in each major browser, as shown below:

- **Google Chrome Console Output**
  ![Chrome Console Output](assets/images/testing/chrome-console.png)

- **Mozilla Firefox Console Output**
  ![Firefox Console Output](assets/images/testing/firefox-console.png)

- **Microsoft Edge Console Output**
  ![Edge Console Output](assets/images/testing/edge-console.png)

All features, including navigation, media links, and form submissions, worked as expected across these browsers. No significant cross-browser issues were identified, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience for all users.

### Edge Case Testing

Additional tests were conducted to ensure that the website performed well under less-than-ideal conditions:

- **Slow Network Conditions**: The website was tested under simulated Slow 4G speeds to evaluate how efficiently images and resources are loaded. The site performed well, with all critical elements remaining visible and a total load time of 2.8 seconds, which is considered optimal under these conditions.
  ![Slow network output](assets/images/testing/slow-network-test.png)

- **Disabled JavaScript**: The website was tested with JavaScript disabled to verify that core functionality remained accessible. Minimal interactive elements were affected, the core content, navigation, and layout were still fully accessible, ensuring a functional experience for users without JavaScript enabled.
  ![Disabled Javascript](assets/images/testing/disabled-js-test.png)

  ### Broken Links Testing

  To ensure that all links on the website are functional and lead to the correct destinations, comprehensive testing for broken links was conducted.

  - **Method**:
    - An automated tool was used to scan the site for broken or inactive links.
    - Each link was also manually tested to ensure proper redirection.

- **Outcome**:
  - All internal and external links were found to be working correctly, with no broken links identified.

Below is a screenshot of the broken link test results:

![Broken Links Test](assets/images/testing/broken-link-test.png)

_Screenshot showing successful broken links testing, with no errors found._

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

During testing, the following issues were identified and addressed:

- **Navigation Bar Overlap on Mobile**: The navigation bar overlapped with content on smaller screens. This issue was resolved by adjusting the `z-index` and adding padding.
- **Form Validation on Mobile**: Error messages for the contact form were not displaying correctly on mobile devices. This was resolved by updating the validation script to ensure proper mobile behavior.

### Remaining Bugs

- **Sticky NavBar On Smaller Devices** The sticky navbar feature is effective on larger screens, providing easy navigation without requiring the user to scroll back to the top. However, this feature has been disabled on smaller devices like smartphones and tablets. Since users can scroll more easily on these devices, the sticky navbar is less critical and might also take up valuable screen space, which is why it was excluded from smaller viewports.

## Conclusion

The website has undergone **extensive and thorough testing** across a wide range of devices, browsers, and network conditions to ensure it meets modern standards for performance, accessibility, and usability. From **automated testing** using tools like the **W3C HTML Validator** and **Lighthouse**, to **manual testing** across multiple devices and browsers, every aspect of the site’s functionality was scrutinized to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Key findings from the testing include:

- **Responsive Design**: The website maintained full functionality and a consistent layout on various screen sizes, including mobile devices and tablets.
- **Accessibility**: With high Lighthouse scores and manual accessibility testing, the site adheres to **WCAG standards**, ensuring that it is accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Techniques such as image compression, code minimization, and caching were used to ensure fast load times even on slower network conditions (e.g., Slow 4G).
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: The website was thoroughly tested in major browsers such as **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, and **Microsoft Edge**, with no issues encountered, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.

Furthermore, **edge case testing** (such as disabling JavaScript and simulating slow network conditions) confirmed that the site remains functional and accessible even in less-than-ideal circumstances, reinforcing its robustness.

### Moving forward:

Continuous monitoring and periodic testing will be conducted to ensure that the website remains fully functional and optimized as new features or content are added. In particular, as new devices and browsers emerge, further testing will be performed to guarantee that the site adapts to future changes in technology.

In summary, the website is optimized for a wide audience, offering a fast, accessible, and consistent experience across all devices and platforms. All identified issues during testing were promptly addressed, ensuring that users, regardless of their device or network condition, will have a high-quality experience.
